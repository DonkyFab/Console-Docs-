A console consists of an input buffer and one or more screen buffers. The mode of a console buffer determines how the console behaves during input or output (I/O) operations. One set of flag constants is used with input handles, and another set is used with screen buffer (output) handles. Setting the output modes of one screen buffer does not affect the output modes of other screen buffers.

The **ENABLE\_LINE\_INPUT** and **ENABLE\_ECHO\_INPUT** modes only affect processes that use [**ReadFile**](/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-readfile) or [**ReadConsole**](../readconsole.md) to read from the console's input buffer. Similarly, the **ENABLE\_PROCESSED\_INPUT** mode primarily affects **ReadFile** and **ReadConsole** users, except that it also determines whether CTRL+C input is reported in the input buffer (to be read by the [**ReadConsoleInput**](../readconsoleinput.md) function) or is passed to a function defined by the application.

The **ENABLE\_WINDOW\_INPUT** and **ENABLE\_MOUSE\_INPUT** modes determine whether user interactions involving window resizing and mouse actions are reported in the input buffer or discarded. These events can be read by [**ReadConsoleInput**](../readconsoleinput.md), but they are always filtered by [**ReadFile**](/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-readfile) and [**ReadConsole**](../readconsole.md).

The **ENABLE\_PROCESSED\_OUTPUT** and **ENABLE\_WRAP\_AT\_EOL\_OUTPUT** modes only affect processes using [**ReadFile**](/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-readfile) or [**ReadConsole**](../readconsole.md) and [**WriteFile**](/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-writefile) or [**WriteConsole**](../writeconsole.md).
